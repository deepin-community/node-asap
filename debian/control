Description: High-priority task queue for Node.js and browsers
 This module executes a task after the scheduled tasks are over
 .
 ASAP strives to schedule events to occur before yielding for IO, reflow, or
 redrawing. ASAP provides a fast event queue that will execute tasks until it
 is empty before yielding to the JavaScript engine's underlying event-loop.
 When a task gets added to a previously empty event queue, ASAP schedules a
 flush event, preferring for that event to occur before the JavaScript engine
 has an opportunity to perform IO tasks or rendering, thus making the first
 task and subsequent tasks semantically indistinguishable. ASAP uses a
 variety of techniques to preserve this invariant on different versions of
 browsers and Node.js
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
